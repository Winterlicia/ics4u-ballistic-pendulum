## How it Works
This project was created in Java Swing GUI.
- Calculates the angle that the pendulum swings up, using parameters such as the bullet's initial velocity or the pendulum's rope length, which can be modified by the user
- Using the angle and rope length, the (x,y) positioning of the bob and sticking bullet are modified to move in a pendulum arc upwards
- Uses javax.swing components for parameters and java.awt for Graphics painting of animations
