## Ballistic Pendulum

This project is a visual representation of how the ballistic pendulum experiment works to demonstrate inelastic collisions.
It calculates the angle that the pendulum swings up, where the user is able to modify parameters such as the bullet's initial velocity or the pendulum's rope length.
